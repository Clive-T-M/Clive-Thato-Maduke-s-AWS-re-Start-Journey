## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about AWS Cloud Netwoking. By the end of the 9 projects, I would have built a Virtual Private Cloud, VPC Traffic Flow and Security, Creating a Private Subnet, Launching VPC Resources, Testing VPC Connectivity,V PC Peering, VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs, Access S3 from a VPC, VPC Endpoints. I'm learning about cloud networking because mastering AWS cloud networking allows me to architect systems that are secure by design, perfomant at scale, and cost-efficient from the start, turning cloud services into cohesive, resilient platforms.

Businesses traditionally had to buy physical servers and manage thier infrustructure to support thier customers needs. Cloud networking changed things by taking up the need to buy and maintain the physical servers that companies would need to buy in order to serve thier company needs, now instead of companies having to physically own server they can simply subscribe to a cloud service provider like AWS, Google cloud services, Azure cloud services and others to handle thier workloads. One of the positive part about this is with AWS customers pay for what they use only saving them tons of money when it comes to use of resources.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 3 hours every day to work on this networking series. I will keep myself accountable by submitting anywork that I have completed on my github account. My reward is gaining valuable skills needed to advance my cloud engineering career

### What are networks?

Computer networks are a system of two or more interconnected devices that communicate and share resources, data and services, they work using physical cables or wireless signals and following the communication protocols to exchange information. This ranges from small networks like ones for our home setups to a wider global network like the internet which enables fuctions like file sharing, web browsing, sending emails and video calls just to name a few.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC is secure isolated virtual network within a a public cloud that lets you run your cloud resources as if they were in your private data center allowing one to have control over the IP address range, subnetsand security settings combining public cloud scalability with private cloud security and isolation. This helps organizations by securing thier virtual networking enviroments which includes IP address, subnets and network gateways...
