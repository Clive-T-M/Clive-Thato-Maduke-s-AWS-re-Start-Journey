### Introduction to Amazon EC2

# This lab provided me with a basic overview of launching, resizing, managing and monitoring an Amazon EC2 instance.

# What is Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)?

# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizeble compute capacity in the cloud. 
# It is designed to make web scalling easier for developers.

# Benefits of Amazon Elastic Cloud Copmute

# The simple web service interface of EC2 allows one to configure capacity with minimal friction. it gives you
# control over your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment in minutes,
# reducing the time needed to spawn new server instances quickly enabling you to scale up or down.
# it also allows user or clients to pay as they go allowing for one to pay for the resources they use

## By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

# Launch a web server with termination protection enabled

# Monitor Your EC2 instance

# Modify the security group that your web server is using to allow HTTP access

# Resize your Amazon EC2 instance to scale

# Test termination protection

# Terminate your EC2 instance
